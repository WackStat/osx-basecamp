## Command





# Homebrew
### Intall / Uninstall

To install Homebrew, paste the command below in a terminal prompt.
Note that `ruby` must be in your path, formulas are just simple ruby scripts!
```bash
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

To uninstall Homebrew, paste the command below in a terminal prompt ...

```bash
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/uninstall)"
```

... or download the [uninstall script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/uninstall)
and run `./uninstall --help` to view more uninstall options.

Create list of install command based on the current state of your brewery

```bash
brew list | sed -e 's/^/brew install /' > osx-brew-formula-install.sh
```

### Updating
Updating the brew system itself

    brew update

Find out what formulas are out dated

    brew outdated

Upgrade everything ...

    brew upgrade

.. or upgrade a specific formula

    brew upgrade $FORMULA

### Adding / Removing formulas

To add a formula

    brew install $FORMULA

To remove a formula

    brew uninstall $FORMULA

If you do not uninstall all of the versions that Homebrew has installed, Homebrew will continue to attempt to install the newest version it knows about when you do (`brew upgrade --all`).

To remove a formula entirely, you may do

    brew uninstall formula_name --force

### Preventing automatic updates
To stop something from being updated/upgraded

    brew pin $FORMULA

To allow that formulae to update again

    brew unpin $FORMULA

### Clean up the brewery
By default, Homebrew does not uninstall old versions of a formula, so
over time you will accumulate old versions.

Check what would be cleaned up

    brew cleanup -n

Clean up everything at once ...

    brew cleanup

or remove a specific old formula

    brew cleanup $FORMULA
